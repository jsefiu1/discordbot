To use the gjirafa scraper you have to write this line:
/scrape gjirafa page_numbers:1
if you want more then 1 page to be scraped from each category,
please change it to the number you desire

To use the data function of gjirafa you have to write like this:
/data gjirafa {parameters}
parameters available are: 'limit','offset','title_contains'
So if you want to return only 3 articles, you go ahead and write:
/data gjirafa limit:3
If you want to use the date filters, limit_price
