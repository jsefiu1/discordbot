The primary function of me (bot) is to scrape and return data to you (user).
The websites available to scrape are: 'Telegrafi', 'Gjirafa', 'Kosovajob'.
For more info on how to use the scraper and the data function,
please type all in lowercase:
/commands [name of the website]
If you want the bot to reply privately, just use '?' before text, for example:
?!help
I also have other functions for different uses. These functions are:
Weather(weather), ChatGPT(gpt), Google-Search(google), Convert Currencies(currencies) and Nasa(nasa).
To use these functions type:
/commands [name of the function in the parentheses]
For example: /commands gpt
