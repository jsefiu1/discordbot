To use the chatGpt function all you have to do is:
type '/gpt' as the first word of the message
and whatever you write after that, it will go 
as a message to chatGPT, ex:
/gpt can you give me some ideas to celebrate my birthday
/gpt has another function for telegrafi website
to summarize the article content so you do not have to 
actually go to the link to read the article, but you can 
do it from discord channel
To use this summarize function, type:
/gpt summarize {Article_ID}
